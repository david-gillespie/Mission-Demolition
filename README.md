# Mission-Demolition
In this game, the player uses a slingshot to fire projectiles at a castle, hoping to demolish it.  Each astlye has a goal area that the projectile must touch for the player to continue to the next level.

This project is completed by following through Chapter 29 Prototype 2: Mission Demolition from Bond's Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development.
